	<h1>Hi there, I'm Shikhar Seth!</h1>
	<p>I'm currently a fellow at Plaksha TLF programme. I graduated as a CS engineer from <a href= "https://jaipur.manipal.edu">Manipal University Jaipur</a> in 2019. Previously I have worked as a research intern at CNRS, Bioretics & DRDO. My research interests lie at the intersection of Neuroscience and Machine Learning. Also wish to work on Federated Learning in the near future!
